# cse493w-tesla-charge-port-project
Repo for my CSE493W project, which records Tesla's "open charge port" radio signal and rebroadcasts it using a HackRF to open Tesla charge ports.

- record_charger_radio.py - records the "open Tesla charge port" signal + saves it.

- send_charger_radio.py - rebroadcasts the saved "open Tesla charge port" signal.
